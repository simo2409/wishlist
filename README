This is a little ruby script useful to manage your wishlist.
Usage of the script is really simple, to add an item:

  $ ruby wishlist.rb add <Item name> <Item price (optional)> <Item url (optional)>
  
to list items in your wishlist:

  $ ruby wishlist.rb ls

to delete an item:

  $ ruby wishlist.rb rm <Item ID>

Data is saved (by default) in './wishlist_data.yml', if you want to change location you can change FILE_PATH variable in the script.

USEFUL SUGGESTION

I'm on a mac with GeekTool installed and enabled. I configured GeekTool to do every 5 minutes 'wishlist ls' and to print on the desktop the output. I find it really useful when I want buy anything I have in front of my eyes my wishlist and I can evaluate if there is anything 'more interesting' of what I'm going to buy :)

Wishlist add

'wishlist add' accepts 3 arguments, the first one (mandatory) is the name of item, the second is the price for the item (optional) and the third is the url of the item (optional).

Consider that price is just a value, it doesn't manage/convert at all currency.

Example:

$ ruby wishlist.rb add iPhone 199$ http://www.apple.com
Item added

If your item name has one (or more) spaces you can use '' or "" around the name so all your text will be used as name.

Example:

$ ruby wishlist.rb add '16bugs.com Big account' 15$ http://16bugs.com/pricing
Item added

===

Wishlist ls

'wishlist ls' prints a list of items added in your wishlist.

Example:

$ ruby wishlist.rb ls
Wishlist:
 1 - iPhone (199$)
  http://www.apple.com
 2 - 16bugs.com Big account (15$)
  http://16bugs.com/pricing

The number before the name is the 'Item ID' (it will be useful in 'wishlist rm').

===

Wishlist rm

'wishlist rm' accepts one argument, the 'Item ID' of the item you want delete.

Example:

$ ruby wishlist.rb rm 1
Item 1 deleted

Consider that delete is final, there is no way to rescue an item after you deleted it.









$ ruby wishlist.rb ls
Wishlist:
No items in your wishlist.
